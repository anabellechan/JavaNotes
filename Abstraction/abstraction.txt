**INTERFACE IS ONE EXAMPLE OF ABSTRACTION**
Abstraction helps us hide implementation complexity

Java supports abstract classes or interfaces
it's easier to contribute to abstract systems
An abstract class is almost like a template class where some of the fuctionality
is not implemented yet
Other classes extend the abstract class and implement the appropriate functionality

Interface in Java
an interface is a set of method signatures for to-be-implemented functionality
It's a specification for a set of behaviors without implementation
An interface cannot be instantiated

A class should only have a single responsibility in a system.
