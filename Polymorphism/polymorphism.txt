Polymorphism
When you inherit from a parent class to a child class, it is like copy pasting all the methods
and properties from the parent to the child. However imagine that instead of just copying everything as is,
you change some parts of the parent class in the process.
This change happens when you override methods in the child class using @Override method.
By doing this, the methods in the child class can behave differently than those in the parent class
As a result, you end up with two versions or forms of the parent class's methods, one from the parent and one of
the child. This concept of having multiple forms of a class's methods is what we refer to as polymorphism.
So when you create these different forms of a parent class, you are practicing polymorphism.
